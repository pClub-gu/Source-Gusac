                              It creates an environment for interested students to evenly space out and implement their ideas. Many students who have potential and are interested in participating in various events fail to do the same, mostly due to lack of proper inter-departmental knowledge and freedom to put forth their ideas. This Centre fills these gaps and provides better prospects for the students of GU. Students are exposed to national level competitions and are provided with a platform to put forth their projects and to gain recognition for their work. Most of the projects aimed at will be targeted towards nation-building, to help the needy and the disabled.
